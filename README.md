# Introduction
The work outflow involves Ask-prepare-Process-Analyze-share-Act data analysis phases
# General Overview about diabetes 
Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that about 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.6 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. According to CDC, more than 34.2 million Americans are living with diabetes and it is the 7th cause of death in the USA.
# Data Description
# Metadata
The database is visible to the public and licensed under CCO: Public domain. It is maintained and owned by UCI Machine Learning Repository. This is a version1 dataset created and last updated on 2016-10-06. 
# Data Collection and preparation
#Source of data
This dataset is originally collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and kidney Diseases from 768 adult (at least 21 years old) female Pima Indians inheritance. 
The dataset for this case study was downloaded from Kaggle at (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) in a csv format 
#Dataset Features
The dataset has 768 observations/individual rows and 9 attributes/columns/features.
There are 8 input/predictor variables that are numerical (quantitative).
1.Pregnancies	        Number of times pregnant
2.Glucose		          Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance
                      test
3.BloodPressure		    Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4.SkinThickness     	Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5.Insulin	          	2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6.BMI            		  Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in meters squared))
7.DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
8.Age	               Age (years)
9.Outcome 	     Test for diabetic status (0 = tested negative, 1 = tested positive)
There is only one response variable ("Outcome") which is qualitative data with boolean data type
# Objectives
  The objective of this case study is:
  1. To identify factors that contribute to the occurrence of diabetes in females of Pima
     Indian heritage.
  2. To determine the relationship between these factors
  3. to compare these factors among the outcome variable and determine their significance.
  
#Selected tools for Analysis
The R programming software of version R-4.0.5 was installed and used for this case- study project.
